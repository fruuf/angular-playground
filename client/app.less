// The less syntax is a superset of css, any valid css is valid less
// If the import statement is requiring a .less file, the file gets included
// and can access all variables within the global scope.
// requiring a css file doesnt include the file but lets the browser deal with it
// with a http request. there is a parameter to hard link css files as well, check the docs.
@import "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css";

// I like to include the less source files of bootstrap directly and compile them by myself
// Since less only creates one global scope its easy to overwrite the bootstrap variables
// after including the bootstrap less file and change the look that way.
@import "./vendor/bootstrap/bootstrap.less";
// Example
// @brand-primary: #ccc;
// see ./vendor/bootstrap/variables.less
